# Machine Learning Algorithms Exploration

This repository contains implementations and experiments with various machine learning algorithms. It serves as a learning platform for exploring algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, PCA, random forest, decision tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, K-means, and KNN. Each algorithm is implemented and tested on different datasets to gain practical understanding and insight into their behavior and performance.

## Introduction

In this repo, I am learning seven supervised learning algorithms and two unsupervised learning algorithms.

## Dataset

Source: [Source of the dataset, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository] .
Format: CSV .
Description: Brief description of the dataset and its features .
Preprocessing Steps:
Finding Missing Values: Checked for missing values using methods like isnull() and info() .
Value Counts: Used value_counts() to understand the distribution of categorical variables .
Shape: Determined the shape of the dataset using the shape attribute .
Basic Data Analysis: Conducted basic data analysis using plots such as histograms, line plots, and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

## Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables.
Application: Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location.
- **Logistic Regression**:Logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.
Application: Predicting whether an email is spam or not based on features like sender, subject, and content.
- **Random Forest**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification or the mean prediction for regression.
Application: Predicting customer churn in a subscription-based service using features like usage patterns, customer demographics, and satisfaction scores.
- **Decision Tree**:  Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attribute values.
Application: Identifying customer segments based on demographic and purchasing behavior for targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in feature space.
Application: Classifying whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not based on features like transaction amount, location, and time.
- **Naive Bayes**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between features.
Application: Classifying documents into categories like sports, politics, or finance based on word frequencies.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure.
Application: Recommending movies to users based on the preferences of similar users in a movie recommendation system.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving most of the variability in the data.
Application: Visualizing high-dimensional data or reducing the dimensionality of features before feeding them into a classifier.
- **K-Means**:K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on similarity.
Application: Segmenting customers into groups with similar purchasing behaviors for targeted marketing strategies.
  
## Usage
You will get all code snippet in jupyter notebook form and for understanding I wrote comments as well .
