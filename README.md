# Machine Learning Algorithms Exploration

This repository contains implementations and experiments with various machine learning algorithms. It serves as a learning platform for exploring algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, PCA, random forest, decision tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, K-means, and KNN. Each algorithm is implemented and tested on different datasets to gain practical understanding and insight into their behavior and performance.

## Introduction

In this section, provide a detailed introduction to your project. Explain the problem you're solving, the goals of the project, and any relevant background information.

## Dataset

Source: [Source of the dataset, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository] .
Format: CSV .
Description: Brief description of the dataset and its features .
Preprocessing Steps:
Finding Missing Values: Checked for missing values using methods like isnull() and info() .
Value Counts: Used value_counts() to understand the distribution of categorical variables .
Shape: Determined the shape of the dataset using the shape attribute .
Basic Data Analysis: Conducted basic data analysis using plots such as histograms, line plots, and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
